|    - The goal of the game is to play the musical notes at the right time, following       |
|    the rhythm of the music. The better your performance, the more points you'll           |
|    score.                                                                                 |

|    - You'll have to master the guitar buttons, represented by the keys "A", "S", and      |

|    - Pay attention to the energy bar, as it represents your performance. If you miss      |
